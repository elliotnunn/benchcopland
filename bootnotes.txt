Copland Boot Notes

Applies to D11E4, other versions not checked.

The Copland installer requires that System 7.5 is already installed (and that
the system file is named "System"), but does not otherwise depend on nor alter
the existing System Folder.

At the filesystem level, the installer copies "Mac OS Folder" and "Mac OS 8
Applications" to the root.

The 4-byte catalog node ID of the Mac OS Folder is placed at offset 0x14 in the
volume Finder info (which itself is at offset 0x45c in the HFS partition). This
is a previously unused field in a data structure that also contains the CNIDs of
the System Folder, the folder to open at startup, and the folder containing the
pre-MultiFinder startup app.

The 'boot' 1 resource of Mac OS Loader is copied to the boot blocks. It differs
from the boot blocks of System 7.1 and later as follows:
	0x15e-0x162:
		"move.l 0x6e(a0),d6" saves the Mac OS Folder CNID for later
	0x186-0x1e6:
		NuKernel booting path...
		0x186-0x1aa: check for compatible hardware, else jump to original code
		0x1aa-0x1b2: check caps lock, else jump to original code
		0x1b2-0x1e6: execute 'nkld' 128 resource in Mac OS Loader

Note that the boot blocks would get overridden if the volume was re-blessed in
traditional Mac OS. But this could be fixed if it becomes annoying.
